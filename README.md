# Data Visualization and Regression Analysis

The project was created for the **STAT 1910** course and utilizes datasets from [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/data/).

## 📖 Project Overview

Our analysis involves detailed **data manipulation**, intuitive **data visualization**, and robust **regression analysis** techniques to identify meaningful patterns and draw predictive insights. We demonstrate the complete analytical workflow—from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling—using the R programming language.

## 🔍 Highlighted Features

- **Data Source**: Datasets provided by OpenIntro.
- **Data Manipulation**: Thorough techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data.
- **Data Visualization**: Engaging visual insights created using `ggplot2`.
- **Regression Analysis**: Comprehensive regression modeling to perform predictions and interpret relationships between variables.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **R** programming language
- **ggplot2** for data visualization
- **R Markdown** for reproducible analysis and reporting
